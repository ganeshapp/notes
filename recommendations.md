# Recommendations

Here are some of the things I recommend.

## Note Taking

### Zettelkasten Method
[Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/) is a way for creating digital garden. It is taking notes that are interlinked and atomic. The more connected the clusters, the more deeper your understanding. In the long run, your thoughts get better.

### Obsidian 
[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is a cross platform software that helps in bidirectional note taking, which helps create associative knowledge, as opposed to hierarchical knowledge which are used to. 

### Foam
Combining Obsidian with [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/) helps keep all your knowledge synced across devices. Foam itself can be used with VS Code. But the feature of finding unlinked references in Obsidian is quite helpful. At some point there will be some workflow in Foam to do the same, but till then I will probably use Obsidian to take the notes and VS Code to sync them to [[github-pages]].


## Workout

### Darebee
[Darebee](https://darebee.com/) is a no-nonsense, straight-forward website which has tones of workout programs. It is free and focuses on the core of working out, which is doing the exercises. It doesn't distract you with logging, social etc. aspects. 

Darebee also has many programs which lets you focus on some aspect of your body. If you just want a full body no-equipment workout, then I recommend [Avatar Upgrade](https://darebee.com/programs/avatar-program.html)

### Bouldering
Climbing/Bouldering is not just a full-body workout, it is also a problem solving exercise. There are more than one ways to solve a bouldering problem depending upon your strengths and weaknesses. 

Bouldering is also travel friendly. As most cities in the world, have some bouldering gym close by. Some of them will also let you rent the shoes, if you didn't bring yours along.
