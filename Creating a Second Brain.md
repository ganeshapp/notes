# Second Brain

With the proliferation of internet, a lot of content is being created. Consuming a lot of content doesn't necessarily lead to meaningful results in life. A Second Brain helps one save their best ideas, organize their learning and dramatically expand their creative output. 

Second Brain is a knowledge management system. It helps collect information, preserve ideas and insights, uncover patterns, promotes clarity and makes you a better writer.

## C.O.D.E System

Capture -> Organize -> Distill -> Express

**Capturing** information from the outside world, **organizing** it into chunks, **distilling** them down to the best parts, and then **expressing** your unique voice through writing, speaking, designing, teaching, and creating.

The difference to other systems is that you create a web of thoughts instead of notes of arbitrary size and form, and emphasize connection, not a collection.
